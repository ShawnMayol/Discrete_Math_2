    "### Question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive the probability distribution of the experiment, we consider the binomial distribution since each trial has only two outcomes: success or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of getting exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials is given by the binomial probability formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(Y = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}$\n",

    "### Question 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "To show that the expectation of this probability distribution is $E[Y] = \\sum y \\cdot P(y) = np$, we use the definition of expected value for a binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value $E[Y]$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k \\cdot P(Y=k)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the binomial probability formula, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[Y] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k \\cdot \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "After simplification and using the properties of binomial coefficients, we arrive at $E[Y] = np$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the probability distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(Y = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^{k} \\cdot (1 - p)^{n-k} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ n $ is the number of trials (10 in this case)\n",
    "- $ k $ is the number of successes (in this case, either 9 or 10)\n",
    "- $ p $ is the probability of success (0.30 in this case)\n",
    "- $ (1-p) $ is the probability of failure\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this formula:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$ P(Y = 10) = \\binom{10}{10} \\cdot (0.30)^{10} \\cdot (1 - 0.30)^{10-10} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the probability of at least nine people recovering is the sum of these probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(Y \\geq 9) = P(Y = 9) + P(Y = 10) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's calculate each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "For $ k = 9 $:\n",

    "$$ P(Y = 9) = \\binom{10}{9} \\cdot (0.30)^{9} \\cdot (1 - 0.30)^{10-9} $$\n",
    "$$ P(Y = 9) = \\binom{10}{9} \\cdot (0.30)^{9} \\cdot (0.70)^{1} $$\n",
    "$$ P(Y = 9) = 10 \\cdot (0.30)^{9} \\cdot 0.70 $$\n",
    "$$ P(Y = 9) \\approx 0.006006 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $ k = 10 $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(Y = 10) = \\binom{10}{10} \\cdot (0.30)^{10} \\cdot (1 - 0.30)^{10-10} $$\n",
    "$$ P(Y = 10) = \\binom{10}{10} \\cdot (0.30)^{10} \\cdot (0.70)^{0} $$\n",
    "$$ P(Y = 10) = 1 \\cdot (0.30)^{10} \\cdot 1 $$\n",
    "$$ P(Y = 10) \\approx 0.0000059049 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, sum these probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(Y \\geq 9) = P(Y = 9) + P(Y = 10) $$\n",
    "$$ P(Y \\geq 9) \\approx 0.006006 + 0.0000059049 $$\n",
    "$$ P(Y \\geq 9) \\approx 0.0060119049 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability that at least nine out of ten people receiving the medication will recover, given that the medication is worthless, is approximately $0.0060119049$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Calculate for no defective fuses in a sample of 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(X = 0) = \\binom{5}{0} \\cdot 0.05^{0} \\cdot (1 - 0.05)^{5}$\n",
    "$= \\binom{5}{0} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0.95^{5}$\n",
    "$= 1 \\cdot 0.95^{5}$\n",

    "To find the expected value of this distribution, start with the definition of expected value:\n",
